This repository contains examples of generalized classes that I have used across multiple projects. 
These classes have been refactored and adjusted to be more generic and suitable for public sharing. 
It is intended for read-only purposes. Inside, you will find examples of:

  - Reactive programming
  - DGS (GraphQL) framework
  - JPA (Java Persistence API)
  - Liquibase and SQL scripts
  - DTO (Data Transfer Objects)
  - JPA (Java Persistence API)
  - Spring Framework
  - Kafka

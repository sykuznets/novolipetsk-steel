This repository contains examples of generalized classes that I have used across multiple enterprise projects. 
They have been refactored and adjusted to be more generic and suitable for public sharing. 
It is intended for read-only purposes. The following technologies are demostrated:

  - Reactive programming
  - GraphQL
  - Java Persistence API
  - Liquibase scripts
  - Hibernate
  - Data Transfer Objects
  - Java Persistence API
  - Spring Framework
  - Kafka

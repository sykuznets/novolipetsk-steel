This repository contains examples of generalized classes that I have used across multiple projects. 
They’ve been refactored and adjusted to be more generic and suitable for public sharing. 
It is intended for read-only purposes. Inside, you will find examples of:

  - Reactive programming
  - GraphQL
  - Java Persistence API
  - Liquibase scripts
  - Hibernate
  - Data Transfer Objects
  - Java Persistence API
  - Spring Framework
  - Kafka
